I am obsessed with reconstructing the real world by models, which combines the beauty of mathematics, the power of computing and the aesthetics of physics principle.

Currently, my research aims to address the question, "How to bond AI algorithms and physics equations to simulate the real world", specifically, on the field of fluid flow and reaction (gas-solid combustion).
