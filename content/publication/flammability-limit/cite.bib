abstract = {In order to provide a reference range for the safe application of C3H8 under O2/CO2 atmosphere, the lower flammability limit of C3H8/O2/CO2 was studied by calculations. A prediction model based on the limited laminar flame speed principle was used to calculate the lower flammability limit of C3H8/O2/CO2 mixture. The effects of elevated temperature and pressure on the lower flammability limit of C3H8 were investigated. How the high CO2 concentration changes the lower flammability limit was also discussed. Results show that the lower flammability limit of C3H8 decreased linearly with the increase of preheating temperatures. The lower flammability limit increased in a logarithmic relation with the increase of pressure. The lower flammability limit increased slightly with increasing CO2 concentration.}
